# Quantile-Regression-Non-asymptotic-Inference
This repository is a Spyder program that allows to run, and test non asymptotic inference for quantile regression. 


To run and compute non asymptotic quantile regression, you just have to use the function Final_Regression(), which uses the packages stats models and numpy.

To understand the theory, use the article (in French) we wrote below.
